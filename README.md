### What's a Inspirations AI Bot?
- It's a tool to post predefined content on Instagram and Twitter about AI art.

### Can I make a similar bot?
- You can use this code however you want, I don't care. But be careful with services from Meta Platforms, Inc.. Some of its services are quite limited.

<br/>

### Where does the app run?
- The application runs on my home Raspberry Pi 4B with PHP 8.1.5 + on public web hosting.
- I use CRON to run a php script at regular intervals.

### How do I get Twitter keys (consumer keys, etc.)?
- You have to register first at https://developer.twitter.com.
- Then you have to get verification to access the ELEVATED level of Twitter API.
- Then just create a project and generate API Key, API Secret, Access Token and Access Secret.
- If you want to use the bot under an account other than your registered one, you must obtain OAuth Twitter tokens for your account through the app you created. I've used WordPress with this add-on (https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextend-facebook-connect/) to do this, and modified it to print OAuth information when you log in.
